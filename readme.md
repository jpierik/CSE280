# SOPHOMORE PROJECT

### Getting Started with Git and Github.

Since you may not be familiar with using git from the command line, we will use
GitHub's desktop application to make things much easier.

1. [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

2. Create a GitHub account if you do not have one.

3. Fork my CSE280 repository. (Top right of this page)

4. Open GitHub Desktop, sign in, and click the "+" on the top left. Select "Clone"
and then select the CSE280 repository you forked from me.

5. Notice the button that says "master" at the top. Never make any changes to this
branch because I will not accept a pull request to the master branch.

6. Always create a new branch when you want to start a new task for the project.
After you have written some code, go into the github desktop app and commit your changes
with a details comment and maybe even a summary. When naming your branch, make it short
but make it meaningful to what you are doing.

7. Commit changes often. Don't wait until you have written a lot of code to make a
commit to the branch you created. It is much easier to fix code that has a good commit
history.

8. Hit the sync button often, especially before you begin working so you can get
updated code. I will always let everyone know when I have merged something into the master
branch, just as a reminder.

9. When you are finished writing code to the branch you created, then make sure you
hit the sync button. Then, go to the top right of the github application and create
a new pull request. It should automatically select the right branch to merge into
my repository. I will always accept your pull request as long as you DON'T WORK FROM
THE MASTER BRANCH. We can all review code before we merge a branch into master.
The master branch is for production code only.

10. Finally, think of something else to add to the program, create a new branch,
and start over again.

### To Make Sure We Are All On The Same page

Lets test this out by making a branch with your name written in camel case.
For example, (using the directions above) I will create a new branch titled
`MichaelFrieze`. Once you have done that, edit the readme.md file (erase whats in there)
and put whatever you want in there. Just remember this is public. Then, just continue to
follow the steps above and I will know that everyone is using github correctly.
Make sure to submit a pull request when you are finished.

Hopefully, my instructions are clear enough. If you need any help just ask.

Thanks,
Michael Frieze
